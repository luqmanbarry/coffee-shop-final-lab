= Advanced Application Deployment with Red Hat OpenShift Final Lab

This repository holds the template for the Final Lab for the Advanced Application Deployment with Red Hat OpenShift ILT.

The files in this repository use placeholders (GUID, OCP_USERNAME, ...) that are replaced as this repository is forked into
the final lab Gitea instance. It will therefore not deploy without changes from this repository.
